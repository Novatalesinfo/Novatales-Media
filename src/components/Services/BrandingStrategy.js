                      Often times history reminds us that how the story is told is more important than what actually happened. It is important to tell the story perfectly and tie it all together with a set of deliberate actions and decisions to ensure that the perceptions and experiences that your customers, clients and other stakeholders have of your company are perfectly aligned with your values.
